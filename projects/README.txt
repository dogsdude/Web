The overall design of the website is listed above. The goal is to make a site
for fans of the seires and those who have never heard of it using progressive enhancement. 
I've planned to include a homepage that links to a bunch of different webpages within the website and
have the idea to make each page relatively similar in terms of layout and design.
They will each have their own unique little things going on inside the webpages,
like music that can be played or gifs that showcase gameplay or videos that 
starup when you enter the website. I also plan to have some additional links to other
websites or things that people may find interesting if they like the Legend of Zelda.
I will be updating this README file as I progress with the work! I'm sure everything will be
changed and shifted araound as I progress too. The "art" page isn't working yet, so please only grade
the Homepage, Music, and Games pages.

Extra Credit: There are a few things that I included in my website that I think deserve to be awarded
extra points. I included links that could get a user from anywhere on the site to anywhere else in the top
nav section. On the homepage I resized my image use the width and height attributes so it would properly fit the page.
On the music section I included a link that skipped the user past the images down to the bottom of the website where
I embedded a bunch of example soundtracks from the game. On the games page I created two different tables which 
and ultilized both the colspan and rowspan attributes as well as a bit of javascript which gives the tables
some borders instead of just leaving all the text free floating. I also created a form that uses radio buttons, submit & reset buttons,
and a field to submit why that game is your favorite one. I also used a ul, a dl and an ol, all three not just one like the requirements
stated.
