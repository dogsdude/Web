The overall design of the website is listed above. I've planned to include
a homepage that links to a bunch of different webpages within the website and
have the idea to make each page relatively similar in terms of layout and design.
They will each have their own unique little things going on inside the webpages,
like music that can be played or gifs that showcase gameplay or videos that 
starup when you enter the website. I also plan to have some additional links to other
websites or things that people may find interesting if they like the Legend of Zelda.
I will be updating this README file as I progress with the work!
