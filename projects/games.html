  <h1> Once upon a time... </h1>
    <p> there was a boy named Link. He lived by himself, with friends, or family in a small village. Life was normal until Link was selected to continue the long
      time honored tradition of wearing the "Heroe's Clothes" for the annual festival celebrating a great hero that vanquished darkness many years ago. Again and again,
      this celebration is held and each time a new darkness arises which Link must then set out from his tiny village to destroy, all while trying to save a princess. A few big monsters,
      some triforces, treasures, a couple instruments, and melodies later the darkness is put to sleep... only to awaken once more 100 years later and to be fought back by the same namesake...
